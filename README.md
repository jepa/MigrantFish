# Project Goal:

Identify straddles between the high seas and EEZs and investigate the effects of climate-induced distribution shifts on the sharing of straddling stocks.

i) which stocks straddle between the high seas and global EEZs 

ii) weather climate change will affect the proportion of the distribution between EEZs and the high-seas.
